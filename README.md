unbook is a command-line program for converting a DRM-free .epub, .mobi,
.azw, .azw3, .lit, or .chm ebook to a self-contained HTML file, which you
can read in any browser. unbook functions as a frontend for Calibre's HTMLZ
functionality and performs some CSS repair to make things easier to read.

from using unbook at all.

Security bugs can be reported like regular bugs.
